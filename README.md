# Usage
After easy setup, now you can use ChivalryBT. Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree) to know what is Behaviour Tree.

## Basic
1. Click menu `GameObject->Behaviour Tree` to create a template.
2. Unfold ChivalryBT.dll and you'll see all nodes.
3. Create an empty GameObject, then drag it under **Sequence** node which is just automatically created in step 1. Drag **Log** node to the empty GameObject. If success, the GameObject you just create will auto renamed as "Log".
4. Pick **Log** node and set argument as "start".
5. In the same way, create **Wait**(set argument as "1") and another **Log**(set argument as "finish") below. Now, there are 3 nodes under **Sequence**.
